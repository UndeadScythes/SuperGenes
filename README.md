# SuperGenes - 0.3.1 #

SuperGenes is primarily a [GEDCOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM) editor
written with full support of standard version 5.5 and further 5.5.x versions. The
application can be run on the command line, supports a variety of different
services and will eventually be expanded with an easy to use GUI.

A superb feature of SuperGenes is its ability to generate a fully operational
HTML/CSS based website very quickly. This website will support customizations
once the GUI has been implemented.
